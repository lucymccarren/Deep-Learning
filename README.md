## MDS for plotting geodesic distance
The dataset for the problem was acquired from the following web page:
https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
The data contains latitudes and longitudes for the worldâ€™s cities. I then used the Python package Geopy to calculate the geodesic distances between the cities, and MDS to plot a 2-d graph.
